## Use a prompt

1. Copy [preamble.txt](preamble.txt).
2. Open a job in [`app/open-desk`](https://github.com/Vicariouso/joshuamangas-com/tree/main/app/open-desk) (`items-a.ts` … `items-k.ts`).
3. Add:

```
Job: <name>

What good looks like:
<job>
```

4. Fill in the school context at the bottom of the preamble.
5. Run it on a machine you control.

For names, health, behaviour, safeguarding or HR, keep the work off public tools.

## Rules the prompts already carry

- UK English.
- Drafts only. Someone with the right role checks before it is sent, filed or used in a meeting.
- Do not invent pupils, staff, data, inspection grades, papers or mark schemes.
- For primary, KS3, GCSE and sixth form: paste the programme of study or the specification. The model must not invent a topic list.
